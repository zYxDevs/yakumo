Yakumo is a free checked proxy list for you to use it what ever you want. The name Yakumo itself is taken from virtual youtuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjXBuHmWkieBApgBhDuJMMQ">Yakumo Beni</a> from <a href="https://vspo.jp/">Virtual Esport Project</a>. Beni is sweets, stylish and cool. But she is not naive in her approach to games. Her style is all about winning and losing, and the amount of practice she takes is what sets her apart from others. She is secretly trying to get a sexy slot in VSPO.<br/><br/><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/PLEASE%20HELP%20ME%20TO%20PAY%20MY%20VPS%20BILL-2e3440?style=for-the-badge"/><br/><a href="https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/elliottophellia"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/BUY%20ME%20A%20COFFEE-2e3440?style=for-the-badge&logo=paypal&logoColor=white"/></a> <a href="https://saweria.co/elliottophellia"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/TRAKTIR%20SAYA%20KOPI-2e3440?style=for-the-badge&logo=BuyMeACoffee&logoColor=white"/></a><br/><a href="https:/t.me/elliottophellia"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/WANT%20TO%20BUY%20ANONYMOUS%2FELITE%20PROXY%20%3F%20CLICK%20HERE-2e3440?style=for-the-badge"/></a>
